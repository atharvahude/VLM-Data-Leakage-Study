The question that Linda and Bob's experiment can best answer is: "Does waxing the underside of a snowboard affect the time it takes to slide straight down a hill?"


Instruction:

Read the passage below and then follow the instructions below.

Linda applied a thin layer of wax to the underside of her snowboard and rode the board straight down a hill. Then, she removed the wax and rode the snowboard straight down the hill again. She repeated the rides four more times, alternating whether she rode with a thin layer of wax on the board or not. Her friend Bob timed each ride. Linda and Bob calculated the average time it took to slide straight down the hill on the snowboard with wax compared to the average time on the snowboard without wax.

Figure: snowboarding down a hill. Identify the question that Linda and Bob's experiment can best answer.


Instruction:

1. Read the passage carefully.
2. Identify the question that Linda and Bob's experiment can best answer.
3. Explain your reasoning.

Solution:

1. The question that Linda and Bob's experiment can best answer is: "Does waxing the underside of a snowboard affect the time it takes to slide straight down a hill?"

2. The reasoning behind this answer is that Linda and Bob are conducting an experiment where they are comparing the average time it takes to slide straight down a hill with a thin layer of wax on the snowboard to the average time without wax. By calculating the average time for each condition and comparing them, they can determine if the wax has any effect on the time it takes to slide down the hill.

3. The question is relevant to the passage because it directly relates to the purpose of the experiment, which is to investigate the effect of waxing the underside of a snowboard on the time it takes to slide down a hill. The passage provides information about the procedure of the experiment, including the application and removal of wax, as well as the number of times the experiment was repeated. This information helps to support the answer to the question.

The choices for this question are:

A) The derivative of f(x) at x=2 is 1 that at x=5
B) The derivative of f(x) at x=2 is -1 that at x=5
C) The derivative of f(x) at x=2 is 1 that at x=5
D) The derivative of f(x) at x=2 is -1 that at x=5

To answer this question, we need to find the derivative of f(x) = |2x - 3| + 1 and evaluate it at x=2 and x=5.

The derivative of f(x) = |2x - 3| + 1 is:

f'(x) = (2x - 3) * (2) / 2 + 0 = 2x - 3

Now, we can evaluate f'(x) at x=2 and x=5:

f'(2) = 2(2) - 3 = 1
f'(5) = 2(5) - 3 = 7

So, the derivative of f(x) at x=2 is 1, and the derivative of f(x) at x=5 is 7.

The correct answer is:

A) The derivative of f(x) at x=2 is 1 that at x=5

The choices for this question are:

1. The bottom perimeter of the paper cap is 12.0.
2. The bottom perimeter of the paper cap is 18.0.
3. The bottom perimeter of the paper cap is 24.0.
4. The bottom perimeter of the paper cap is 36.0.

To determine the correct answer, we need to calculate the bottom perimeter of the paper cap using the given information.

The formula for the circumference of a circle is C = 2πr, where C is the circumference and r is the radius.

In this case, the radius is 6.0.

C = 2π(6.0) = 12.0π

Since the bottom of the paper cap is a semicircle, the bottom perimeter is half the circumference of the circle.

Bottom perimeter = (1/2) * 12.0π = 6.0π

Therefore, the correct answer is:

1. The bottom perimeter of the paper cap is 6.0π.

However, since the choices are given in decimal form, we can approximate the value of π as 3.14.

Bottom perimeter ≈ 6.0 * 3.14 = 18.84

The closest choice to 18.84 is 18.0.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

2. The bottom perimeter of the paper cap is 18.0.

To find the degree of ∠CAB, we need to use the properties of a circle and the given information about the angles.

Given:
- AB is the diameter of ⊙O
- CD is a chord of ⊙O
- ∠ADC = 26.0 degrees

We know that in a circle, the angle subtended by a diameter at the circumference is always 180 degrees. Since AB is the diameter, ∠CAB is an angle subtended by the diameter at the circumference.

Now, we have ∠ADC and ∠CAB as part of the same arc. Since AB is the diameter, the arc subtended by AB is twice the measure of the central angle subtended by AB. Therefore, the measure of the central angle subtended by AB is 180 degrees.

Since ∠ADC and ∠CAB are part of the same arc, they are supplementary angles. This means that the sum of their measures is 180 degrees.

So, we have:
∠ADC + ∠CAB = 180 degrees

Given that ∠ADC = 26.0 degrees, we can find the measure of ∠CAB:
∠CAB = 180 degrees - 26.0 degrees
∠CAB = 154 degrees

Therefore, the degree of ∠CAB is 154 degrees.

The answer is (A) 154 degrees.

The choices for this question are:

1. Sample A has a higher temperature.
2. Sample B has a higher temperature.
3. Both samples have the same temperature.

To answer this question, we need to compare the average kinetic energies of the particles in each sample.

The average kinetic energy of a gas particle is given by the formula:

\[KE = \frac{3}{2}kT\]

where \(KE\) is the average kinetic energy, \(k\) is the Boltzmann constant, and \(T\) is the temperature in Kelvin.

Since both samples have the same number of particles, we can compare their average kinetic energies by comparing their temperatures.

Given that the mass of each particle in Sample A is 40 u and the mass of each particle in Sample B is 32 u, we can calculate the average speed of the particles in each sample using the formula:

\[v = \sqrt{\frac{3kT}{m}}\]

where \(v\) is the average speed, \(k\) is the Boltzmann constant, \(T\) is the temperature in Kelvin, and \(m\) is the mass of each particle.

For Sample A:

\[v_A = \sqrt{\frac{3kT_A}{40 u}}\]

For Sample B:

\[v_B = \sqrt{\frac{3kT_B}{32 u}}\]

Since the average speed of the particles in Sample A is 950 m/s and the average speed of the particles in Sample B is 750 m/s, we can calculate the temperatures of each sample using the formula:

\[T = \frac{m v^2}{3k}\]

For Sample A:

\[T_A = \frac{40 u (950 m/s)^2}{3k}\]

For Sample B:

\[T_B = \frac{32 u (750 m/s)^2}{3k}\]

Comparing the temperatures of each sample, we can see that Sample A has a higher temperature than Sample B.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

The choices for this question are:

A. 12 cm
B. 18 cm
C. 24 cm
D. 30 cm

The correct answer is B. 18 cm.

To solve this problem, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

In this case, we have a right triangle with one side (AB) being 16 cm, and the other side (AC) being 6 cm. We want to find the length of the hypotenuse (CD).

Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can set up the equation:

AB^2 + AC^2 = CD^2

16^2 + 6^2 = CD^2

256 + 36 = CD^2

292 = CD^2

CD = √292

CD ≈ 18 cm

So, the correct answer is B. 18 cm.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the degree of ∠CDE.

Given:
∠ABC = 60.0

We know that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.

∠ABC + ∠BCD + ∠ACD = 180

Since points A, B, C, and D are on circle O, ∠ACD is a central angle. The measure of a central angle is twice the measure of the inscribed angle that intercepts the same arc.

∠ACD = 2 * ∠CDE

Now, we can substitute the given values into the equation:

60.0 + ∠BCD + 2 * ∠CDE = 180

We need to find the measure of ∠CDE.

∠CDE = (180 - 60.0 - ∠BCD) / 2

Since ∠BCD is an inscribed angle, its measure is half the measure of the arc it intercepts.

∠BCD = 1/2 * ∠AOB

∠BCD = 1/2 * 180

∠BCD = 90

Now, we can substitute the value of ∠BCD into the equation:

∠CDE = (180 - 60.0 - 90) / 2

∠CDE = 30 / 2

∠CDE = 15

Therefore, the degree of ∠CDE is 15.

The answer is: 15
