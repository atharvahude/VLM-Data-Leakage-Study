To do this, we can take the average of the thickness at the two endpoints of each interval. The average thicknesses are 11.9, 11.4, 13.45, 18.75, 22.85, 24.55, 24.05, 17.25, 12.575, 6.575, and 1.1.\n\nNow, we can estimate the area of the wing's cross-section by multiplying the average thickness at each midpoint by the width of the wing (200 cm). The estimated area is 200 * (11.9 + 11.4 + 13.45 + 18.75 + 22.85 + 24.55 + 24.05 + 17.25 + 12.575 + 6.575 + 1.1) = 200 * 160.5 = 32,100 cm\u00b2.\n\nThe final value is 32,100 cm\u00b2.",
