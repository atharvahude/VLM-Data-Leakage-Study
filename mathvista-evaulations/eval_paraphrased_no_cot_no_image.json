Since the acceleration is one-fifth of the acceleration due to gravity, it is 1/5 * 9.8 m/s^2 = 1.96 m/s^2.\n2. Next, we can use the kinematic equation to find the final velocity of the elevator after falling 12 meters: v^2 = u^2 + 2as, where v is the final velocity, u is the initial velocity, a is the acceleration, and s is the distance. Plugging in the values, we get v^2 = (4.0 m/s)^2 + 2 * 1.96 m/s^2 * 12 m = 16 m^2/s^2 + 47.04 m^2/s^2 = 63.04 m^2/s^2. Taking the square root, we get v = 7.94 m/s.\n3. Now, we can use the work-energy principle to find the work done on the elevator by the upward tension from the elevator cable. The work done is equal to the change in kinetic energy of the elevator, which is given by 1/2 * m * (v^2 - u^2), where m is the mass of the elevator. Plugging in the values, we get W = 1/2 * 500 kg * (7.94 m/s)^2 - 1/2 * 500 kg * (4.0 m/s)^2 = 19700 J - 5000 J = 14700 J.\n4. Finally, we need to convert the work done from joules to kilojoules by dividing by 1000: 14700 J / 1000 = 14.7 kJ.\n5.
