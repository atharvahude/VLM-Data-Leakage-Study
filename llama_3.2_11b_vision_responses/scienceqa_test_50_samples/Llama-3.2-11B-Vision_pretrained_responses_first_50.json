Chiasmus is a reversal of the order of words in a phrase, which is not present in this sentence. (Skill 1b)  The term \"apostrophe\" is used to describe a figure of speech in which a speaker addresses a nonhuman entity, such as a person, place, or object. In the example above, Homer addresses the goddess, using the second person pronoun \"you\" to do so. The term \"chiasmus\" is used to describe a figure of speech in which the order of words in a phrase is reversed. In the example above, the order of the words is not reversed, so this is not an example of chiasmus.

He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Gordon put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel.

The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re\u00adacts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same.

Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nIf an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIf an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.\nA Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce.

The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re\u00adacts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.","solution":"Step 1: Think about each change.\nButter melting on a hot day is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The butter changes from solid to liquid, but it is still made of the same type of matter.\nMixing sand and water is a physical change. Adding water makes the sand wet. But both the sand and water are still made of the same type of matter as before.\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice.\nBoth are only physical changes.\nBoth changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.\nBoth are chemical changes.\nBoth changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.\nBoth are caused by heating.\nButter melting on a hot day is caused by heating. But mixing sand and water is not.\nBoth are caused by cooling.\nNeither change is caused by cooling.","response":"<|begin_of_text|><|begin_of_text|>Question:\nWhat do these two changes have in common?\nbutter melting on a hot day\nmixing sand and water\nOptions:\n 0) Both are caused by cooling.\n 1) Both are only physical changes.\n 2) Both are caused by heating.\n 3) Both are chemical changes.\n Answer the above Question by choosing the correct Option number. A) 0 B) 1 C) 2 D) 2 and 1 E) 1 and 2\nAnswer: E\nThe best answer is E. (E)  Both are physical changes. Melting butter is a physical change because the butter changes from a solid to a liquid, but it is still butter. Mixing sand and water is a physical change because the sand and water can be separated again. Both of these changes are not caused by heating or cooling, so choices 0 and 2 are incorrect. Choice 3 is incorrect because neither of these changes results in a new substance.

The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.\nImagine being told that a pencil is 16 long. You might be thinking, 16 what? Is the pencil 16 centimeters long? 16 meters? 16 kilometers?\nThe number 16 on its own does not give you much information about the length of the pencil. That is because the units are missing.\nNow look at the drawing of the pencil and the ruler. The ruler shows that the units are centimeters. So, the length of the pencil is 16 centimeters.\nThere are 100 centimeters in 1 meter. So, 1 centimeter is much shorter than 1 meter.\nThere are 1,000 meters in 1 kilometer.
