Woolly fleeces, which have shorter hairs, are usually used for clothing and blankets. Hairy fleeces, which have longer hairs, are usually used for carpets.\nIn a group of sheep, some individuals have a hairy fleece and others have a woolly fleece. In this group, the gene for the fleece type trait has two alleles. The allele for a hairy fleece (F) is dominant over the allele for a woolly fleece (f).\nThis Punnett square shows a cross between two sheep.","task":"closed choice","grade":"grade8","subject":"natural science","topic":"biology","category":"Genes to traits","skill":"Use Punnett squares to calculate ratios of offspring types","lecture":"Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?\nHow do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nIf an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIf an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.\nA Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.\nFor example, consider the Punnett square below.\n | F | f\nF | FF | Ff\nf | Ff | ff\nThere is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.\n","solution":"To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with a woolly fleece or a hairy fleece, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the fleece type trait. The question tells you that the F allele, which is for a hairy fleece, is dominant over the f allele, which is for a woolly fleece.\nA woolly fleece is the recessive allele's version of the fleece type trait. A sheep with the recessive version of the fleece type trait must have only recessive alleles for the fleece type gene.

A sheep with the dominant version of the fleece type trait must have at least one dominant allele for the fleece type gene. So, offspring with a hairy fleece must have the genotype FF or Ff.\nThere are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype FF or Ff.\nSo, the expected ratio of offspring with a woolly fleece to offspring with a hairy fleece is 4:0.

This is why the initial mobilization of troops was not as extensive as it would have been if people had realized that the war would last for four years. Only Option 2 reflects this belief. Option 1 is incorrect because World War I was not the first of two world wars. Option 0 is incorrect because the war was not predicted to be the longest in history. Option 3 is incorrect because the war was not expected to be over quickly. (Skill 1c) The Treaty of Versailles was imposed on Germany after the end of World War I. It imposed harsh penalties on Germany, including heavy reparations. Option 2 is the only choice that reflects this. Option 1 is incorrect because the treaty was not imposed on the United States. Option 0 is incorrect because the treaty was not imposed on the Central Powers. Option 3 is incorrect because the treaty was imposed on Germany, not the Allies. (Skill 1d) The Treaty of Versailles imposed harsh penalties on Germany, including heavy reparations. Option 2 is the only choice that reflects this. Option 1 is incorrect because the treaty did not impose penalties on the United States. Option 0 is incorrect because the treaty was imposed on Germany, not the Central Powers.

The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re\u00adacts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.","solution":"Step 1: Think about each change.\nButter melting on a hot day is a change of state.

The two processes that are described are evaporation and freezing. Evaporation is a physical change because it occurs without a change in the chemical composition of the substance. Freezing is also a physical change because it is the opposite of melting and, like melting, occurs without a change in the chemical composition of the substance. Choice (1) is correct because both evaporation and freezing are physical changes. Choice (2) is incorrect because neither evaporation nor freezing is caused by cooling. Evaporation is a result of heat, not cold. Freezing is the result of cold. Choice (3) is incorrect because both evaporation and freezing are not chemical changes. Choice (4) is incorrect because both evaporation and freezing are not caused by heating. Evaporation is the result of heat, and freezing is the result of cold.

According to Newton's third law, the wheelchair must exert an equal and opposite force on Darnel.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the type of force\nSince Darnel is pushing on the wheelchair, the force exerted by the wheelchair on Darnel must be a reaction force that is opposite in direction to the action force exerted by Darnel on the wheelchair.

Answer: 1) no. The Rafflesia plant is a parasitic plant that does not have roots, stems, or leaves. It is found in the rainforests of Southeast Asia and is known for its large, showy flowers. The Rafflesia plant is a parasitic plant that grows on the roots of certain trees in the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It does not have roots, stems, or leaves, and it does not photosynthesize like most plants. Instead, it obtains its nutrients by tapping into the roots of its host tree. The Rafflesia plant is known for its large, showy flowers, which can grow up to 3 feet in diameter. The flowers are red or yellow in color and have a strong, unpleasant odor. The Rafflesia plant is considered an endangered species due to habitat loss and over-harvesting. Conservation efforts are underway to protect the plant and its habitat. The Rafflesia plant is a unique and fascinating species that is worth learning more about. Its unusual appearance and interesting biology make it a popular subject of study among botanists and naturalists. Overall, the Rafflesia plant is a remarkable example of the diversity and complexity of life on Earth. Its unique characteristics and adaptations make it an important part of the ecosystem, and its conservation is crucial for maintaining the health of the rainforests of Southeast Asia. *Answer*: 1) no.
