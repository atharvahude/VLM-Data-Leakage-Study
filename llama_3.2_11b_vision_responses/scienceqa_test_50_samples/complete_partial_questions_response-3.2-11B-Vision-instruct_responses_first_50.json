The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.","solution":"Step 1: Think about each change.\nCompost forms from the remains of plants and animals, such as vegetable scraps and egg shells.

Compost rotting and a piece of apple turning brown are both examples of oxidation because they both involve the loss of electrons. Compost is made up of organic materials like leaves and food scraps. When these materials break down, they release electrons. This process is called oxidation. Similarly, when an apple is cut, the cells on the surface are damaged, allowing oxygen to enter the cells. The oxygen reacts with the cells and causes the apple to turn brown. This is also an example of oxidation.\nThe correct answer is (3) both are examples of oxidation.

The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re\u00adacts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.","solution":"Step 1: Think about each change.\nButter melting on a hot day is a change of state.

The definition of an angiosperm is a plant that is a member of the family of flowering plants (Angiosperms) and produces seeds and is able to make its own food through photosynthesis and has flowers and is able to reproduce sexually. Angiosperms are the most diverse group of plants and are characterized by their flowers, fruits, and seeds. They are also able to produce their own food through photosynthesis, which is the process of converting light energy from the sun into chemical energy. This process occurs in the leaves of angiosperms, which contain specialized cells called chloroplasts that contain the pigment chlorophyll. Angiosperms are also able to reproduce sexually, which means they produce gametes (sperm and egg cells) that fuse to form a zygote, which develops into a new plant. This process of reproduction allows angiosperms to produce offspring with unique combinations of traits, which is a key factor in their diversity. Therefore, the correct answer is 5, as it accurately describes the characteristics of angiosperms. 1) is incorrect because it does not specify the production of seeds. 2) is incorrect because it does not specify the ability to make its own food through photosynthesis. 3) is incorrect because it does not specify the presence of flowers. 4) is incorrect because it does not specify the ability to reproduce sexually.

This is because the experiment involves observing the behavior of the Northern Cardinal at a bird feeder, which suggests that it is designed to study the bird's feeding habits. By observing what the Northern Cardinal eats at the feeder, Chase can gather data on its diet.\n\n**Answer:** 2) What is the diet of the Northern Cardinal?  The Northern Cardinal's diet consists mainly of seeds, fruits, and insects. They are known to visit bird feeders, particularly those with sunflower seeds, safflower seeds, and suet. In the wild, they forage for seeds, fruits, and insects on trees and shrubs. They may also eat spiders and other small invertebrates. In the winter, they may eat berries and other fruits. In captivity, they are often fed a diet that includes commercial seed mixes, fruits, and insects. It's worth noting that the diet of the Northern Cardinal may vary depending on the season and location. In the breeding season, they may eat more insects and other protein-rich foods to support their young. In the winter, they may eat more seeds and fruits to conserve energy.

The answer is: 1) Yes. Rafflesia arnoldii, commonly known as the corpse flower, is a parasitic plant that belongs to the genus Rafflesia. It is native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia, specifically in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand. The plant is known for its unique and distinctive appearance, with large, red, and foul-smelling flowers that can reach up to 3 feet in diameter. Rafflesia arnoldii is a holoparasite, meaning it derives its nutrients and water from other plants, typically a type of vine called Tetrastigma. The plant has no roots, stems, or leaves, and its only visible part is the flower, which can grow up to 3 feet in diameter and weigh up to 15 pounds. The flower has a strong, unpleasant odor that is often compared to the smell of rotting flesh, which helps to attract pollinators such as flies and beetles. Rafflesia arnoldii is considered an endangered species due to habitat loss and poaching, and conservation efforts are underway to protect this unique and fascinating plant. Overall, Rafflesia arnoldii is a remarkable and unusual plant that continues to capture the imagination of scientists and nature enthusiasts alike. *Answer*: 1) Yes.
