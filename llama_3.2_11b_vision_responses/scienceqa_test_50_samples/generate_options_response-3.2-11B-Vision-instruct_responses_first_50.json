He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Gordon put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel.

The correct way to organize a dictionary is alphabetically by first name. This is because dictionaries are organized to make it easy for people to find words, and the first letter of each word is the most important part of the word for this purpose. In order to find a word in a dictionary, you need to know the first letter of the word. If the dictionary were organized by last name, first name, or date of birth, it would be much harder to find a word, because the last name, first name, and date of birth are not as important for this purpose. The subject is not relevant to organizing a dictionary.\nWhat is the main purpose of a dictionary?\nA) to entertain\nB) to educate\nC) to organize words alphabetically\nD) to provide definitions for words\nAnswer: D\nThe main purpose of a dictionary is to provide definitions for words.

The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re\u00adacts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.","solution":"Step 1: Think about each change.\nCompost forms from the remains of plants and animals, such as vegetable scraps and egg shells. Compost rotting is a chemical change. As the compost rots, it breaks down and turns into a different type of matter.\nA piece of apple turning brown is a chemical change. The apple reacts with oxygen in the air and turns into a different type of matter.\nIf you scrape off the brown layer of the apple, the inside is still white. The inside hasn't touched the air. So the chemical change didn't happen to that part of the apple.\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice.\nBoth are only physical changes.\nBoth changes are chemical changes.

This process is known as oxidation. In the case of compost rotting, microorganisms break down organic matter, releasing carbon dioxide and water while taking in oxygen. When an apple is cut, the cells are damaged, allowing oxygen to react with the iron in the apple's cells, resulting in the formation of brown pigment. Metal rusting occurs when iron reacts with oxygen and moisture, forming iron oxide. In each case, oxidation is the common factor that drives the reaction. \nThis question requires the test-taker to identify the underlying chemical process that connects the three examples, demonstrating their understanding of oxidation and its role in various chemical reactions. The incorrect options, such as \"They all involve biological processes\" or \"They all involve chemical reactions,\" are plausible but incorrect, as they do not specifically address the commonality of oxidation among the examples. The correct answer requires the test-taker to think critically and apply their knowledge of chemistry to identify the underlying connection between the examples. \n\nThe best answer is They all undergo oxidation. .html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">html\">"}

Hairy fleeces, which have longer hairs, are usually used for carpets.\nIn a group of sheep, some individuals have a hairy fleece and others have a woolly fleece.

Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nIf an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIf an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.\nA Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce.

The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re\u00adacts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.","solution":"Step 1: Think about each change.\nButter melting on a hot day is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The butter changes from solid to liquid, but it is still made of the same type of matter.\nMixing sand and water is a physical change. Adding water makes the sand wet. But both the sand and water are still made of the same type of matter as before.\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice.\nBoth are only physical changes.\nBoth changes are physical changes.

Mixing sand and water to make concrete is a change of state from solid (sand) to a mixture of solid (water) and liquid (cement). Therefore, the correct answer is c) They both change the state of matter. The other options are not correct because they are not true for both examples. Butter melting does not occur naturally, it is a result of the heat. Mixing sand and water to make concrete is a human-made process and does not require electricity. Therefore, options a) and d) are incorrect. Option b) is incorrect because while heat is involved in the melting of butter, it is not involved in the mixing of sand and water to make concrete.

What is the main purpose of a hypothesis in a scientific experiment? a) To prove a theory b) To make predictions about a scientific phenomenon c) To test a scientific theory d) To make a conclusion about a scientific phenomenon Answer: c) To test a scientific theory Explanation: A hypothesis is a educated guess that can be tested through experimentation. The main purpose of a hypothesis is to test a scientific theory by making predictions about a scientific phenomenon. The correct answer is c) To test a scientific theory. Option a) is incorrect because a hypothesis is not a theory. A theory is a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world, and it is not something that can be proven. Option b) is incorrect because while a hypothesis may make predictions, its main purpose is to test a theory. Option d) is incorrect because a hypothesis is not a conclusion. A conclusion is a statement that summarizes the results of an experiment. The correct answer is c) To test a scientific theory. (Skill 3.5) 7.
