He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Gordon put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.","task":"closed choice","grade":"grade8","subject":"natural science","topic":"science-and-engineering-practices","category":"Engineering practices","skill":"Evaluate tests of engineering-design solutions","lecture":"People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems.

She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.\nFirst, identify what was tested.

A) 0\nB) 1\nC) 2\nD) 5\nE) 3\nThe best answer is B. (Skill 2) Lichens are symbiotic organisms composed of fungi and algae or cyanobacteria. The fungi obtain nutrients from the algae or cyanobacteria, and the algae or cyanobacteria obtain water and minerals from the fungi. In the process, the lichen also produces organic matter that can be consumed by other organisms. The bilberry (option 0) is an organism that consumes organic matter from lichens. The mushroom (option 1) is also a fungus, but it is not a lichen. Therefore, the correct answer is 0. Choice 2 is incorrect because the question asks which organism consumes lichen, not which organism is a lichen. Choice 3 is incorrect because the question asks which organism consumes lichen, not which organism is a part of a lichen. Choice 4 is incorrect because the question asks which organism consumes lichen, not which organism is a type of lichen. Choice 5 is incorrect because the question asks which organism consumes lichen, not which organism is a part of a lichen. (Skill 2) (Medium) (Adapted from AP Environmental Science 2001) 1. Which of the following is a major cause of acid rain? A) Burning of fossil fuels B) Deforestation C) Overfishing D) Pollution of waterways E) Overpopulation\nAnswer: A Acid rain is caused by the emission of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides into the atmosphere, which react with water and oxygen to form acid rain. These pollutants are released into the atmosphere by the burning of fossil fuels. The other choices are not correct because deforestation is a cause of global warming, overfishing is a cause of the depletion of marine ecosystems, pollution of waterways is a cause of the contamination of water sources, and overpopulation is a cause of habitat destruction and resource depletion. (Skill 2) (Medium) (Adapted from AP Environmental Science 2001) 2. What is the primary cause of the greenhouse effect? A) Burning of fossil fuels B) Deforestation C) Overfishing D) Pollution of waterways E) Overpopulation\nAnswer: A The greenhouse effect is caused by the emission of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, which traps heat and causes global warming.

The allele for a hairy fleece (F) is dominant over the allele for a woolly fleece (f).\nThis Punnett square shows a cross between two sheep.","task":"closed choice","grade":"grade8","subject":"natural science","topic":"biology","category":"Genes to traits","skill":"Use Punnett squares to calculate ratios of offspring types","lecture":"Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?\nHow do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nIf an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIf an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.\nA Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.\nFor example, consider the Punnett square below.\n | F | f\nF | FF | Ff\nf | Ff | ff\nThere is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.\n","solution":"To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with a woolly fleece or a hairy fleece, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the fleece type trait. The question tells you that the F allele, which is for a hairy fleece, is dominant over the f allele, which is for a woolly fleece.\nA woolly fleece is the recessive allele's version of the fleece type trait. A sheep with the recessive version of the fleece type trait must have only recessive alleles for the fleece type gene. So, offspring with a woolly fleece must have the genotype ff.\nAll 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype ff.\nA hairy fleece is the dominant allele's version of the fleece type trait. A sheep with the dominant version of the fleece type trait must have at least one dominant allele for the fleece type gene. So, offspring with a hairy fleece must have the genotype FF or Ff.\nThere are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype FF or Ff.\nSo, the expected ratio of offspring with a woolly fleece to offspring with a hairy fleece is 4:0. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will always produce offspring with a woolly fleece. This cross is expected to never produce offspring with a hairy fleece.","response":"<|begin_of_text|><|image|><|begin_of_text|>Question:\nWhat is the expected ratio of offspring with a woolly fleece to offspring with a hairy fleece?

(Skill 2) When the Punnett square for this cross is drawn, we find that there is a 4:0 ratio of offspring with a woolly fleece to those with a hairy fleece. If you do not know how to draw a Punnett square, you can use the following shortcut. Since the woolly fleece is recessive and the hairy fleece is dominant, the only way that an offspring can have a woolly fleece is if both parents are homozygous recessive. The only way that an offspring can have a hairy fleece is if at least one parent is homozygous dominant. Since neither parent is homozygous recessive, there can be no offspring with a woolly fleece. Therefore, the correct answer is choice (B). Choices (C) and (D) are incorrect because they both include offspring with a woolly fleece. Choice (E) is incorrect because it includes offspring with a hairy fleece. Choice (A) is incorrect because it includes offspring with a hairy fleece.  The correct answer is (B). (Skill 3) The Punnett square is a graphical representation of the possible genotypes of the offspring of two parents. To draw a Punnett square, we start by writing the possible genotypes of the gametes (sperm or egg cells) of each parent along the sides of a square. The genotype of each offspring is the combination of the genotypes of its parents. In this case, the Punnett square is:  | WW | Ww |  | W | w |  | WW | Ww | ww |  | WW | ww | ww | WW | Ww | ww | ww |  | WW | WW | WW | WW | WW | WW | WW | WW | WW | WW | WW | WW | WW | WW | WW | WW | WW | WW | WW | WW | WW | WW | WW | WW | WW | WW | WW | WW | WW | WW | WW | WW | WW | WW | WW | WW | WW | WW | WW | WW | WW | WW | WW | WW | WW | WW | WW | WW | WW | WW | WW | WW | WW | WW | WW","is_response_correct":true}

Producers are organisms that make their own food through photosynthesis. In this food web, the primary consumers are the organisms that eat the phytoplankton, which are the producers. In this case, the black crappie (option 1) is the only organism that eats phytoplankton, making it the primary consumer. Therefore, the correct answer is (B). Choice (A) is incorrect because copepods eat phytoplankton but also eat zooplankton. Choice (C) is incorrect because bacteria are decomposers. Choice (D) is incorrect because it is the combination of the incorrect choices. Choice (E) is incorrect because there is a primary consumer in the food web.

The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re\u00adacts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.","solution":"Step 1: Think about each change.\nButter melting on a hot day is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The butter changes from solid to liquid, but it is still made of the same type of matter.\nMixing sand and water is a physical change. Adding water makes the sand wet. But both the sand and water are still made of the same type of matter as before.\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice.\nBoth are only physical changes.\nBoth changes are physical changes.

A) 0 B) 1 C) 2 D) 2 and 1 E) 1 and 2\nAnswer: E\nThe best answer is E. (E)  Both are physical changes. Melting butter is a physical change because the butter changes from a solid to a liquid, but it is still butter. Mixing sand and water is a physical change because the sand and water can be separated again. Both of these changes are not caused by heating or cooling, so choices 0 and 2 are incorrect. Choice 3 is incorrect because neither of these changes results in a new substance.

A) 0\nB) 1\nC) 2\nD) 2\nE) 3\nThe best answer is B. (1) Both are only physical changes. When butter melts, the butter changes from a solid to a liquid. When sand and water mix, the sand does not change its chemical composition. The sand and water mixture is still sand and water, and you can separate the components again. Both of these changes are only physical changes. (Skill 3) The processes of melting butter and mixing sand and water are both physical changes. They do not change the chemical composition of the substances involved. Butter can still be melted again and the sand and water can be separated again. A chemical change would be a reaction that changes the chemical composition of the substance, like rusting or burning. Choices 0, 2, and 3 are incorrect because neither change is caused by cooling, both changes are caused by heating, and both are chemical changes. (Skill 1) Choice 1 is correct because both of the processes are physical changes. Butter melts and becomes a liquid, but it does not change its chemical composition. The same is true for mixing sand and water. The sand and water mixture is still sand and water, and the components can be separated again. Choice 0 is incorrect because melting butter is caused by heating, not cooling. Choice 2 is incorrect because both changes are caused by heating, not cooling. Choice 3 is incorrect because both changes are physical changes, not chemical changes. A chemical change would be a reaction that changes the chemical composition of the substance, like rusting or burning. (Skill 3) Butter melts when it is heated, and sand and water mix when they are mixed together. This is an example of a physical change. The butter is still butter, and the sand and water mixture is still sand and water. Choice 0 is incorrect because melting butter is caused by heating, not cooling. Choice 1 is incorrect because melting butter is a physical change, but it is caused by heating. Choice 3 is incorrect because melting butter is a physical change, not a chemical change. A chemical change would be a reaction that changes the chemical composition of the substance, like rusting or burning.

The statements provided are unrelated to plants, with the first statement being about oak trees (a type of plant) but the second statement being about orcas (a type of animal). The correct answer is \"Neither of the above\" because neither statement is related to plants. This requires the test-taker to use inductive reasoning to analyze the statements and eliminate the incorrect options.  Inductive Reasoning is a type of logical reasoning that involves making generalizations or drawing conclusions based on specific observations. In this case, the test-taker must observe that neither statement is related to plants and make a generalization that neither option is correct.  This type of reasoning is essential in real-life situations where we need to evaluate information, identify patterns, and make informed decisions.  In this question, the test-taker must use inductive reasoning to analyze the statements and eliminate the incorrect options, demonstrating their ability to think critically and make logical connections.  The question requires the test-taker to think beyond the information provided and make a generalization about the relationship between the statements and the topic of plants.  This type of question is an example of inductive reasoning because it requires the test-taker to make a generalization based on specific information.  The question is self-contained, and the answer can be determined without requiring any external knowledge.  The question is also relevant to the topic of plants, and the answer requires the test-taker to think critically about the relationship between the statements and the topic.  The question is also relevant to the topic of inductive reasoning, as it requires the test-taker to make a generalization based on specific information.  The question is also a good example of a question that requires inductive reasoning because it requires the test-taker to think critically about the information provided and make a logical connection between the statements and the topic.  The question is also a good example of a question that requires inductive reasoning","is_response_correct":""}

E) Can't be determined\nAnswer: A\nExplanation:\nThe best answer is A. A thermometer is a scientific instrument used to measure temperature. The temperature is measured in degrees. The temperature is measured in degrees Fahrenheit or degrees Celsius. The thermometer has a dial that indicates the temperature. The dial has two scales: the Fahrenheit scale and the Celsius scale. The Fahrenheit scale is divided into 180 degrees, with 32 degrees being the freezing point and 212 degrees being the boiling point. The Celsius scale is divided into 100 degrees, with 0 degrees being the freezing point and 100 degrees being the boiling point. The thermometer in the figure shows a temperature of 100\u00b0F. Therefore, the correct answer is (A). Big Idea 3: Algorithms and Programming. The question requires the student to analyze the thermometer and determine the temperature it shows. This requires the student to understand the properties of a thermometer and how to read the temperature. This is an example of algorithmic thinking, as the student must follow a series of steps to determine the temperature. The student must analyze the thermometer, identify the temperature, and select the correct answer. This requires the student to think critically and make connections between the thermometer and the temperature. The student must also understand the concept of temperature and how it is measured. This requires the student to apply mathematical concepts to a real-world scenario. The student must also be able to select the correct answer from the options, which requires an understanding of the properties of the thermometer and the temperature it shows.

A plant with a short stem has the genotype hh. If you selected (E), you may have confused the genotype with the phenotype. A plant can only have one genotype, not two. A plant can have one phenotype or more, depending on the trait. For example, a plant can have a tall stem (phenotype) and a genotype of HH. It can also have a tall stem and a genotype of Hh. A plant with the genotype Hh is heterozygous for the stem height gene. This means that the plant has one dominant allele (H) and one recessive allele (h). The H allele is dominant, so the plant will express the dominant trait (a tall stem). The h allele is recessive, so the plant will not express the recessive trait (a short stem). The genotype Hh is heterozygous, but the phenotype is homozygous dominant. The only way a plant will be homozygous recessive is if the genotype is hh. If the genotype is hh, the plant will have a short stem (phenotype). There is no genotype for a short stem, but the genotype hh is recessive, so the plant will have a short stem. Choice (E) is incorrect because it says that the plant has two different genotypes. The correct genotype for a tall stem is HH. There is no genotype for a short stem.

A) 0 B) 1 C) Neither D) Both E) Both 0 and 1\nThe best answer is E. (E)  Both 0 and 1. Stretchy and blue are both properties of a rubber band. (Skill 2a)  A rubber band is an example of an elastic object. Elastic objects, such as rubber bands, springs, and elastic strings, are capable of being stretched or compressed. Rubber bands are typically made of a flexible material, such as rubber, and are used to bind or secure objects together. They are also often used to create tension, or resistance to stretching. Rubber bands are also often colored, and are commonly blue, black, or red.  (Skill 2b)  A rubber band is also an example of an object that can be compressed. Compressible objects are those that can be squeezed or packed into a smaller space. Examples of compressible objects include balls, pillows, and rubber bands. When you compress a rubber band, you are decreasing its volume. The rubber band will then spring back to its original shape when the force that is compressing it is removed. (Skill 2c)  Rubber bands are also an example of a physical object that can be used to demonstrate the concept of potential energy. Potential energy is the energy an object has because of its position or state. When a rubber band is stretched, it has potential energy. When the rubber band is released, the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy, or the energy of motion. The rubber band is said to have a high potential energy when it is stretched, and a low potential energy when it is not stretched. (Skill 2d)  A rubber band is also an example of an object that can be used to demonstrate the concept of friction. Friction is the force that opposes motion between two surfaces that are in contact. When a rubber band is stretched and then released, the rubber band experiences friction as it rubs against other objects, such as the surface it is stretched across. This friction slows down the motion of the rubber band. (Skill 2e)  A rubber band is also an example of an object that can be used to demonstrate the concept of gravity. Gravity is a force that attracts objects with mass towards each other. Rubber bands are subject to the force of gravity, and will fall towards the ground if they are dropped. (Skill 2f)  A rubber band is also an example of an object that can be used to","is_response_correct":""}

This means that if object A exerts a force on object B, then object B will exert an equal and opposite force on object A.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze the situation\nIn the given scenario, Darnel is pushing on the wheelchair. According to Newton's third law, the wheelchair must exert an equal and opposite force on Darnel.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the type of force\nSince Darnel is pushing on the wheelchair, the force exerted by the wheelchair on Darnel must be a reaction force that is opposite in direction to the action force exerted by Darnel on the wheelchair. This means the wheelchair must be pulling on Darnel.\n\n## Step 4: Choose the correct option\nBased on the analysis, the correct option is the one that states the wheelchair is pulling on Darnel.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$![](http:\/\/www.mathopenref.com\/img\/arrow\/arrow_right.gif) Read the explanation for more details.![](http:\/\/www.mathopenref.com\/img\/arrow\/arrow_right.gif) Read the explanation for more details.![](http:\/\/www.mathopenref.com\/img\/arrow\/arrow_right.gif) Read the explanation for more details.![](http:\/\/www.mathopenref.com\/img\/arrow\/arrow_right.gif) Read the explanation for more details.![](http:\/\/www.mathopenref.com\/img\/arrow\/arrow_right.gif) Read the explanation for more details.![](http:\/\/www.mathopenref.com\/img\/arrow\/arrow_right.gif) Read the explanation for more details.![](http:\/\/www.mathopenref.com\/img\/arrow\/arrow_right.gif) Read the explanation for more details.![](http:\/\/www.mathopenref.com\/img\/arrow\/arrow_right.gif) Read the explanation for more details.![](http:\/\/www.mathopenref.com\/img\/arrow\/arrow_right.gif) Read the explanation for more details.![](http:\/\/www.mathopenref.com\/img\/arrow\/arrow_right.gif) Read the explanation for more details.![](http:\/\/www.mathopenref.com\/img\/arrow\/","input_prompt":"<|begin_of_text|>Question:\nAccording to Newton's third law, what other force must be happening?\nOptions:\n 0) The wheelchair is pushing on Darnel.\n 1) The wheelchair is pulling on Darnel.\n Answer the above Question by choosing the correct Option number.","modified_question":"Question:\nAccording to Newton's third law, what other force must be happening?\nOptions:\n 0) The wheelchair is pushing on Darnel.\n 1) The wheelchair is pulling on Darnel.\n \nAnswer the above Question by choosing the correct Option number.","llama_paraphrased_questions":"\nWhat corresponding force is taking place, as stated by Newton's third law of motion?\n\nOptions:\n 0) Darnel is being pushed by the wheelchair.\n 1) Darnel is being pulled by the wheelchair.\nAnswer the above Question by choosing the correct Option number.","input_prompt_without_nouns":"<|begin_of_text|>Question:\nAccording to Newton 's third , what other must be happening ?\nOptions:\n 0) The is pushing on Darnel .\n 1) The is pulling on Darnel .\n Answer the above Question by choosing the correct Option number.","without_noun_response":"<|begin_of_text|><|begin_of_text|>Question:\nAccording to Newton's third, what other must be happening?\nOptions:\n 0) The is pushing on Darnel.\n 1) The is pulling on Darnel.\n Answer the above Question by choosing the correct Option number.
