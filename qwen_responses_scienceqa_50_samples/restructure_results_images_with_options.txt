Question: Which of the following organisms is the primary consumer in this food web?
Actual Choices: ['copepod', 'black crappie', 'bacteria']
Model Output: To determine the food web in the image, we need to identify the primary consumers and their food sources. The primary consumers in the image are:

1. Copepod
2. Rotifer
3. Water flea

These organisms are shown to be consumed by other organisms in the food web. Specifically:

- The copepod is consumed by the black crappie.
- The rotifer is consumed by the black crappie.
- The water flea is consumed by the black crappie.

Therefore, the food web in the image is:

1. Copepod → Black crappie
2. Rotifer → Black
