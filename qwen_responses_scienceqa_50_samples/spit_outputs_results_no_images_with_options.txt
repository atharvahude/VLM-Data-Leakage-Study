Question: Based on this information, what is this pea plant's genotype for the stem height gene?
Actual Choices: ['HH', 'a tall stem']
Model Output: To determine the genotype of the pea plant for the stem height gene, we need to analyze the phenotype of the plant. The image shows a pea plant with a tall stem.

1. **Identify the Phenotype**: The plant has a tall stem.
2. **Understand the Genotypes**: 
   - The genotype 'HH' represents a plant with two dominant alleles (H), resulting in a tall stem.
   - The genotype 'hh' represents a plant with two recessive alleles (h), resulting in a short stem.

Since the plant has a tall stem, it must have at least one dominant allele (H). Therefore
