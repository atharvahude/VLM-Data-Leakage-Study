Question: Think about the magnetic force between the magnets in each pair. Which of the following statements is true?
Actual Choices: ['The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.', 'The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1.', 'The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2.']
Model Output: To determine which pair of magnets will attract each other, we need to consider the orientation of the magnetic poles. Magnets attract opposite poles (North to South and South to North).

Let's analyze each pair:

### Pair 1:
- The first magnet has its North pole facing up and its South pole facing down.
- The second magnet has its South pole facing up and its North pole facing down.

Since the North pole of the first magnet is facing the South pole of the second magnet, these poles will attract each other.

### Pair 2:
- The first magnet has its North pole facing up and its South pole facing down.
