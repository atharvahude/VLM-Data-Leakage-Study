Rearranging, we get $x^2-mx+b^2-b=0$. Since the square touches the line at only one point, the quadratic equation has only one solution. Therefore, the discriminant is equal to zero.\n\nThe discriminant of the quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$ is $b^2-4ac$. In our case, $a=1$, $b=-m$, and $c=b^2-b$. Setting the discriminant equal to zero, we get $(-m)^2-4(1)(b^2-b)=0$. Simplifying, we get $m^2-4b^2+4b=0$. Since $m$ and $b$ are real numbers, the discriminant must be positive. Therefore, $m^2-4b^2+4b>0$. Dividing by 4, we get $m^2-4b^2+4b>0$. Factoring, we get $(m-2b)^2>0$. Since $m$ and $b$ are real numbers, the discriminant must be positive. Therefore, $m-2b>0$. Adding 4b to both sides, we get $m-2b+4b>4b$. Simplifying, we get $m>0$. Since $m$ is positive, $m$ must be greater than 0. Therefore, the value of $x$ is $\\boxed{0}$.\n\nThe answer is: 0"

The volume for 1986 is 25 million ton-km, which is higher than the average of 18.56 million ton-km.\\nAnswer: (A) 1986"

Calculate the midpoint thickness for each segment:\n\n   - Segment 1: (5.8 + 20.3) / 2 = 12.55 cm\n\n   - Segment 2: (20.3 + 26.7) / 2 = 23.5 cm\n\n   - Segment 3: (26.7 + 29.0) / 2 = 27.85 cm\n\n   - Segment 4: (29.0 + 27.6) / 2 = 28.3 cm\n\n   - Segment 5: (27.6 + 27.3) / 2 = 27.45 cm\n\n   - Segment 6: (27.3 + 23.8) / 2 = 25.55 cm\n\n   - Segment 7: (23.8 + 20.5) / 2 = 22.15 cm\n\n   - Segment 8: (20.5 + 15.1) / 2 = 17.8 cm\n\n   - Segment 9: (15.1 + 8.7) / 2 = 11.9 cm\n\n   - Segment 10: (8.7 + 2.8) / 2 = 5.75 cm\n\n\n2. Calculate the area of each segment:\n\n   - Segment 1: 12.55 cm * 200 cm = 2510 cm\u00b2\n\n   - Segment 2: 23.5 cm * 200 cm = 4700 cm\u00b2\n\n   - Segment 3: 27.85 cm * 200 cm = "
