        "question": "An audio compression method called a perceptual audio codec processes audio signals by dividing them into groups of four parts called \"barks,\" which are then categorized into subbands. The codec assigns bits to each subband based on an analysis of the spectrum, using a psychoacoustic model. All samples within a subband are quantized using the same quantization method, with the number of bits determined by the codec. The Bark scale is a psychological scale introduced by Eberhard Zwicker in 1961. Figure Q1a displays the frequency spectrum of a section of audio after being processed. Figure Q1b shows the psychoacoustic model used within the audio codec to establish the masking threshold for the audio segment. How many potential maskers can be identified in Figure Q1a?",
